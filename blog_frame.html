                                    Here brings another blog post of a recent shoot, I’m so behind in updating my work online so I have a few more shoots to post in the next coming weeks.
                                    This set of images were taken for the talented and sweet, Catherine Traicos whom is a musician originally from Perth, living in Sydney Australia. On the day of the shoot we’d planned to meet up and spend the afternoon shooting on suburban streets, lighting candles and burning sage sticks.

We were ever so lucky to be able to shoot at Concrete Swan’s beautiful pad thanks to the swift organisation skills of Emma from Dropstitch.

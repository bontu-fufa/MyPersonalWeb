                    A memoir about Trevor Noah's early life in South Africa, with frequent asides describing the atmosphere during apartheid. Noah's mother is a black South African woman, and his father is a white German man. 
                    This was illegal in South Africa, as mixed marriages were not allowed and mixed-race children could be deemed evidence of a crime.After Trevor is born, he must live in a way that does not give away his mixed parentage, which makes life hard for his mother. 
                    A gifted mimic, Trevor learned to become “a chameleon,” using language to gain acceptance in school and on the streets. All this challenges becouse of his face color.

                    From her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.
